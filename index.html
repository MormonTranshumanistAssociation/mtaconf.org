                      Philosophers and political scientists have long debated the challenge of balanced and sustainable governance.
                      The problem of collective action or preference coordination has kept power sharing limited. For most of recorded
                      history, humanity has been compelled to choose between chaos and tyranny, with power usually concentrated
                      within a relatively small group led by a single dictator.

                      The technologies used for democratic governance haven't undergone significant

                    <p>
                      More recently, representative democracy has begun to gain favor over other more autocratic forms of government,
                      improving preference coordination but still demanding significant compromises between expeditious execution
                      and broad consensus gathering. The technologies used for democratic governance haven't undergone significant
                      upgrades since the American experiment nearly 250 years ago.

                      Recent innovations commonly referred to as Web3 have made it possible to coordinate the preferences of
                      large numbers of people in real time while providing greater information assurance than ever. In addition to
                      preference coordination at massive scale, more complex, novel forms of coordination can be engineered that
                      enable broader variety in the forms that government may take and render obsolete the traditional dichotomy of
                      autocracy vs. anarchy. Constrained by the guardrails of these new technologies, it becomes possible for
                      individuals and communities to pursue their own objectives while also promoting the common welfare. While
                      protocols for decentralized governance are still in their infancy, they already show great promise. These
                      technologies will enable corporations and countries to organize themselves more effectively and to understand
                      the will of their constituents better and more instantaneously than before.

                      In addition to their potential benefit for the public and private sectors, Web3 technologies offer a solution
                      to the problems posed by today's social media outlets, where centralized control over network infrastructure
                      creates perverse incentives for value capture that weaken the social commons. Adverse outcomes from this
                      value capture include disinformation campaigns, declines in mental health, election manipulation and even
                      genocide. Web3 enables user- and community-owned social media alternatives that facilitate robust social
                      interaction in which stakeholder incentives are properly aligned. A confluence of additional technological
                      innovations like video streaming, telepresence, mobile broadband, and remote working, are enabling
                      greater collaboration with decreased reliance on centralized infrastructure.

                      From an ethical perspective, it seems that the more we are capable of distributing and decentralizing the
                      exercise of power while maintaining effective governance of shared resources, the less potential there will
                      be for abuse of power, bureaucratic inefficiencies, or neglect of disenfranchised individuals.

                      "I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves." (Joseph Smith)
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      As religious transhumanists, we notice compelling theological underpinnings to these trends. Mormon
                      pioneers were well-known for their resourcefulness, industry, and willingness to adopt unconventional
                      methods of governance, establishing numerous settlements in the western frontiers of North America. The
                      restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was governed by "common consent" (D&C 26:2), and the
                      Book of Mormon speaks of the necessity of individual agency and responsibility, exhorting believers to
                      avoid monarchy and "do [their] business by the voice of the people" (Mosiah 29:26). When asked how he was
                      able to govern so many people effectively, Joseph Smith replied, "I teach them correct principles, and
                      they govern themselves" (John Taylor, “The Organization of the Church,” <em>Millennial Star</em>, Nov. 15, 1851, p.
                      339). Beyond its admonitions on earthly governance, Mormon theology teaches that the destiny of every
                      follower of Christ is to be made "equal in power, and in might, and in dominion" to God (D&C 76:95), thus
                      prescribing an optimal degree of power sharing and decentralization in the governance of heaven.
